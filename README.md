# OriNet: Robust 3-D Orientation Estimation With a Single Particular IMU

This repository contains OriNet data for comparison on the EuRoC MAV Dataset.

The CSV files contain the estimated quaternions and ground truth for specific time steps of each sequence.

Please do not hesitate to send me an e-mail (mahdi001@e.ntu.edu.sg) if you had any questions regarding implementation, etc.

The main accomplished works on IMU orientation estimation, and inertial odometry:
